 # 12V and 5V Regulated Power supply

 ## Introduction:
 - -A regulated power supply  provides a stable voltage regardless of variations in input voltage or load conditions.
                                                                                                                                          .
## Components Required

- Step-down transformer 
- Bridge Rectifier - Four diodes (1N4007) 
- Capacitors - 1000µF/25V, 470µF/25V, 0.1µF
- Voltage Regulators - 7805  and 7812 
- Resistors - 1kΩ 
- LEDs
- PCB or Perfboard 
- Heat Sinks 
- Wires and Connectors
-  
## Circuit Design 

- Step-down Transformer: Converts 230V AC to 15V AC.
- Bridge Rectifier: Converts AC voltage to pulsating DC voltage.
- Filtering Capacitor: Smoothens the rectified DC voltage.
- Voltage Regulators: The 7812 voltage regulator outputs 12V DC, and the 7805 voltage regulator provides a stable 5V DC.
- Output Filtering: Additional capacitors (0.1µF) are used to remove high-frequency noise.

## Working Principle

- The transformer steps down the high-voltage AC to 15V AC.
- The bridge rectifier (four diodes arranged in a bridge configuration) converts AC to DC.
- A filter capacitor smoothens the DC signal by reducing ripples.
- The 7812 and 7805 voltage regulators regulate the voltage to 12V and 5V, respectively.
- The final output is a stable 5V and 12V DC supply.
 
## Applications

- Microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- Sensors and actuators
- Embedded systems
- DC motors and relays
  
# Note:
Ensure proper heat dissipation using heat sinks for voltage regulators to prevent overheating and potential failure.
