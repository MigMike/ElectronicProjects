# Design and Operation of a Regulated Multi-Output DC Power Supply for Electronics Applications

## Abstract

This article presents the design and operational principles of a regulated multi-output DC power supply, suitable for powering electronics projects and experimental setups. The system performs AC-to-DC conversion through a sequence of well-defined stages: voltage transformation, rectification, filtering, and regulation. Component substitutions and enhancements are discussed to improve performance and meet application-specific requirements.

## Introduction

Modern electronics systems require clean, stable DC voltage sources for reliable operation. Directly powering circuits from AC mains is unsafe and incompatible with most components. Thus, an intermediate power supply is essential to convert high-voltage AC into one or more regulated DC outputs. The system described herein employs a step-down transformer, bridge rectifier, smoothing capacitor, and a two-stage voltage regulation approach that includes both a linear regulator and a zener regulation.

## **Transformer Stage**

The first stage of the power supply employs a center-tapped EI-76X45 transformer, specified for a 220V AC primary and a 24V-0-24V AC secondary with a current capacity of 5A.

### Purpose

The transformer performs electrical isolation and reduces the high-voltage AC mains to a safer, low-voltage level suitable for further processing. The center tap on the secondary provides a ground reference, enabling efficient full-wave rectification using a bridge configuration.

### Design Considerations

The ±24V AC outputs facilitate dual polarity and full-wave rectification, while the 5A current rating supports moderate to high power loads such as motor drivers, embedded systems, and power-hungry development platforms.

## **Rectification Stage**

Following the transformer, AC voltage is converted into pulsating DC using a bridge rectifier composed of four HER307 fast-recovery diodes.

### Purpose

This stage converts the low-voltage AC output from the transformer into unidirectional current, forming the basis for the subsequent filtering and regulation stages.

### Technical Details

The HER307 diodes, rated for 1000V reverse voltage and 3A forward current, are well-suited for high-efficiency rectification. The peak DC voltage after rectification is theoretically:

$$
V_{\text{peak}} = 24\,\text{V} \times \sqrt{2} \approx 33.9\,\text{V}
$$

Accounting for diode forward voltage drops (\~1.4V), the effective DC voltage is approximately 32.5V.

## **Filtering Stage**

To reduce the ripple inherent in rectified DC, a high-capacitance electrolytic capacitor is introduced immediately after the rectifier.

### Purpose

This capacitor smooths the pulsating DC waveform, providing a more consistent voltage for sensitive downstream circuitry.

### Implementation

A 4700µF, 50V electrolytic capacitor is employed, selected for its ability to store significant charge and its voltage margin above the 32–34V expected peaks. This component reduces ripple voltage to within 400–600 mV under typical load conditions.

## **Regulation Stage**

The regulation stage is bifurcated into a linear regulator for auxiliary voltage control.

### Linear Regulation – LM317T

An LM317T linear voltage regulator is utilized to derive a stable 12V DC output from the filtered supply. This regulated voltage is primarily used to power the 555 timer IC that drives the buck converter.

#### Enhancements

To improve transient response and output stability, standard bypass capacitors (0.33µF at input, 0.1µF at output) are replaced with 1µF, 50V capacitors.

### PWM Buck Converter

To efficiently step down the supply voltage to a user-defined level, a PWM buck converter is implemented using a 555 timer IC as a control signal generator.

#### Purpose

This stage provides adjustable, high-current, low-voltage DC output with significantly better efficiency than linear regulation, especially at large voltage differentials and higher current draws.

#### Circuit Details

* **PWM Generation:** The 555 timer operates in astable mode, producing a square wave whose frequency and duty cycle are controlled by:

  * A 1kΩ resistor (charge path),
  * A 47kΩ resistor (discharge path),
  * A 2.2nF (222) timing capacitor,
  * Two 1N4148 diodes to separate charge/discharge cycles.

* **Switching Element:** An IRF540N N-channel MOSFET replaces a standard Z44 device, offering superior R\_DS(on) and gate charge characteristics.

* **Rectification and Energy Storage:** A MBRF20100CT Schottky diode provides fast, low-loss freewheeling action, while a 47µH inductor and a 4700µF output capacitor filter the switched waveform into a smooth DC voltage.

* **Output Control:** A 50k potentiometer adjusts the duty cycle, allowing user control over the output voltage. A 10k bleeder resistor ensures slow discharge of the output capacitor, mitigating residual voltage hazards.

## **Summary**

The described power supply efficiently converts 220V AC mains into a range of regulated DC outputs through a series of logically sequenced stages:

* **Step-Down Transformation:** A center-tapped transformer reduces and isolates mains voltage.
* **Rectification:** A bridge rectifier creates a pulsating DC voltage.
* **Filtering:** A high-value capacitor smooths the voltage waveform.
* **Regulation:**

  * An LM7812 provides fixed 12V for control logic.
  * A 555-based PWM buck converter delivers an adjustable, high-efficiency DC output.

The system is well-suited for laboratory, prototyping, or embedded use cases where flexible and stable power delivery is essential. Through careful component selection and circuit design, it combines robustness, efficiency, and configurability.
