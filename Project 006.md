# Design and Operation of a Multi-Output Regulated DC Power Supply for Electronics Applications

## **Abstract**

This article details the design and operation of a regulated multi-output DC power supply suitable for powering multiple electronic circuits simultaneously. Built using fundamental analog components, the system is powered from a standard 220V AC mains and delivers four regulated outputs: 24V, 12V, 5V, and 3.3V. Key components include a step-down transformer, bridge rectifier, filter capacitors, LM317T linear regulators, and a Zener diode. This power supply is ideal for prototyping labs, embedded system development, and educational purposes in electronics.

## **Introduction**

Most electronic circuits require a stable DC voltage source for reliable operation, yet standard power outlets provide 220V AC in many countries. Converting this AC supply to suitable DC levels involves several stages: voltage transformation, rectification, filtering, and regulation.

This article presents a complete and beginner-friendly design that:

* Converts 220V AC to multiple low-voltage DC outputs
* Offers four regulated output levels: 24V, 12V, 5V, and 3.3V
* Uses discrete linear regulators (LM317T) instead of prebuilt modules
* Demonstrates key principles of analog power electronics

## **Circuit Overview**

### **Multisim and Bench Circuit Diagram**

*Figure 1 and Figure 2 below illustrate the simulated and physical circuit respectively.*

## **Transformer Stage – Voltage Step-Down**

**Transformer Specifications:**

* Type: EI-76X45
* Output: 24-0-24V AC, 5A, 50Hz

A center-tapped step-down transformer converts the 220V AC mains to 24-0-24V AC. The center tap provides a grounded reference, enabling full-wave rectification. The peak voltage after rectification reaches approximately 34V.

### **Simulation Output**

## **Rectification Stage – AC to DC Conversion**

A full-wave bridge rectifier using four HER307 high-speed diodes (D1–D4) converts the AC voltage into pulsating DC. The diodes have the following specifications:

* Average Forward Current: 3A
* Peak Reverse Voltage: 1000V
* Fast Recovery Time

### **Peak Voltage Calculation**

$V_{peak} = V_{rms} \times \sqrt{2} = 24V \times 1.414 \approx 33.9V$

Accounting for two diode drops (\~1.4V):

$V_{DC} \approx 33.9V - 1.4V = 32.5V$

### **Simulation Output**

## **Filtering Stage – Ripple Reduction**

**Bulk Filtering:**
A 4700μF, 50V electrolytic capacitor is used to smooth the rectified voltage and reduce ripple.

**Additional Capacitors:**
Smaller capacitors (100μF, 33μF) placed after each regulator further suppress high-frequency noise and improve transient response.

## **Voltage Regulation Stage – LM317T Adjustable Regulators**

The LM317T is a 3-terminal adjustable regulator capable of supplying 1.2V to 37V at up to 1.5A. It maintains regulation regardless of load (within thermal and voltage limits).

**Output Voltage Formula:**
$V_{out} = 1.25V \times \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1}\right)$

### **24V Output (U1)**

* R1 = 1kΩ, R2 = 18.2kΩ
* $V_{out1} = 1.25 \times (1 + 18.2k / 1k) \approx 24V$
* Use: Powering relays, motor drivers, audio amplifiers
* Capacitors: 300μF and 33μF

### **12V Output (U2)**

* R1 = 1kΩ, R2 = 8.6kΩ
* $V_{out2} = 1.25 \times (1 + 8.6k / 1k) \approx 12V$
* Use: Logic circuits, op-amps, development boards

### **5V Output (U3)**

* R1 = 240Ω, R2 = 720Ω
* $V_{out3} = 1.25 \times (1 + 720 / 240) = 5V$
* Use: Microcontrollers, USB-powered devices

## **3.3V Zener Clamp**

A 1N4728A Zener diode clamps the 5V rail to 3.3V for low-current applications.

* Zener Voltage: 3.3V
* Power Rating: 1W
* Series resistor (10Ω) limits current

**Note:** Zener diodes are not efficient for high-current regulation; use only for low-power logic or reference lines.

## **Thermal and Safety Considerations**

* **Heat Dissipation:** LM317s can dissipate significant heat. For example:
  $P = (32V - 5V) \times 1A = 27W$
  Use heat sinks accordingly.
* **Enclosure:** Use a ventilated metal or plastic enclosure.
* **Fusing:** Place fuses or PTC resettable fuses after the transformer.
* **Isolation:** Ensure the transformer provides safe mains isolation.

## **Applications**

This multi-output power supply is:

* ✅ Ideal for educational electronics labs
* ✅ Simple and low-cost to build
* ✅ Versatile for powering multiple circuit types

**Typical Use Cases:**

* Microcontroller prototyping
* Powering 5V/12V modules simultaneously
* Audio circuits with 24V rails
* Logic-level shifting or analog reference supply

## **Conclusion**

This article outlined the complete design of a linear, multi-output DC power supply using:

* A 24-0-24V transformer
* HER307 diodes for full-wave rectification
* LM317T regulators for adjustable outputs (24V, 12V, 5V)
* A Zener diode for 3.3V low-current applications

Each stage was explained with theoretical justification and simulation results, making the design educational and practical for beginners in analog electronics.
